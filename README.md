## description

Taste Harmony is a practical website designed to discover new recipes based on entered ingredients. Taste Harmony is meant to take the stress out of the never-ending question of "what do I want to make to eat today?"

## user story

As a home cook who has run out of ideas,
I want to be able to find recipes based around the criteria I determine
so that I can find a new suitable recipe quickly and easily.

## acceptance criteria

Given a recipe finding web page,
when I open Taste Harmony
then I am presented with a landing page containing links to navigate the page

when I navigate to the recipe builder tab
then I am prompted to fill out my preferred nutrients and available ingredients

when I submit my preferences
then I am presented with recipes that contain my specified choices

when I view my resulting recipes
then I can find the recipe title, an image of the recipe, cook time, and a link to the recipe website

when I navigate to the "surprise me" page
then I am presented with a random recipe
